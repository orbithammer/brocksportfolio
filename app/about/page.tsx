          <p className="about-text mt-2">I am a frontend developer who adheres to the KISS design principle. I love to learn anything that will improve my craft and incorporate <strong><em>any and all</em></strong> feedback.</p>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-4">Interests</h2>
          <p className="about-text mt-2">I&apos;m a nature-loving solarpunk. I&apos;m into marching up mountains and squeezing in the occasional book or movie when I can.</p>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-4">Why programming?</h2>
          <p className="about-text mt-2">I have always dabbled in programming. One of my first memories is of taking a course on BASIC back in the day. When opportunities arose during my teaching career, I would use my beginner Python skills to automate the boring stuff.</p>
          <p className="about-text mt-2">And then the pandemic changed everything. Teaching was comfortable, but there was no next step along that career path. I had to do a radical re-evaluation of what I wanted from work. There was only one job in the center of the Venn diagram of &ldquo;what I&apos;m good at&rdquo;, &ldquo;what I enjoy doing&rdquo;, and &ldquo;what&apos;s employable&rdquo;: programming!</p>
